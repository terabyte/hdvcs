add support for overriding permissions (since git doesn't version-control
perms and ssh key files need to be chmod 600, for example).

add functionality which kills dead symlinks when files get renamed, moved, or
deleted instead of leaving them dangling.  How should this be done?

  look in destination directory for links pointing to source directory and also
  whose destination file doesn't exist...that should do it...
